# Automated AI-based pick-and-place system using Fischertechnik 3D-Robot 24V

## Robot model:
Fischertechnik 3D-Robot 24V (https://www.fischertechnik.de/en/products/simulating/training-models/511938-sim-3d-robot-24v-simulation)

## Goal: 
Reproducing a scenario of a pick and place system with proximity sensor and object recognition (AI)

Main objects in the scene:
- 1 conveyor belt
- 1 proximity sensor (photoelectric)
- Fischertechnik 3D-Robot 24V
- Siemens PLC
- 2 webcams

## How to run the system
#### Server Side
- Create a Python Virtual Environment (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- Install all the required Python packages (OpenCV, Numpy, Tensorflow) using the requirments txt.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Connect the computer and the PLC with an ethernet cable
- Connect two USB webcams to the computer (one for object detection, one for working environment monitoring)
- Modify the configuration file (conf/configuration.yml) according to your setup (IP addresses, webcam IDs)
- Run the server.py script

#### Client Side
- Create a Python Virtual Environment (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- Install all the required Python packages (OpenCV, Numpy, Tensorflow) using the requirments txt.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run the client.py script

## About
This repository contains the server and client python files, the PLC code (a ladder diagram realized with TIA Portal), a simulation video and the documentation. The project was created by two university students (Vincenzo Aricò and Enrico Catalfamo) at UNIME (University of Messina). It is part of the Industrial automation and robotics (IAAR) course, specifically, the first project for Module B.
